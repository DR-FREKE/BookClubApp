*** Quidax Book Club App***

** PLEASE USE FIREFOX FOR BETTER EXPERIENCE
* the index file is in the view folder; 
  navigate to the view folder and click on the index.html file. 
  The app is also hosted in the heroku server, at quidaxbookclubapp.herokuapp.com.

* I assumed the project was going to be in react, I must say I was suprise it's vanilla JS.

* Most of my uncompleted task were in the media query for mobile device.

* when the source code folder is downloaded, unzip the package, 
  navigate to Views, then to run the index.html. Don't mind the php and composer
  file, I only used it to host the application on heroku.

* The only issues I had was bad power supply and the time give ratioed with that
  bad supply was tasking.

* For this type of project, I'll always prefer to use a more componentize type of
  language like REACT.JS. The App looks easy but could grow.
